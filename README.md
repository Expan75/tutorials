# tutorials

This repo will contain a set of jupyter notebooks to demonstrate different techniques within data science.
Especially, these tutorials will focus on the marriage of different techniques and how they function together.

As of now, the one tutorial-notebook focuses on teaching how to utilise unsupervised learning for latent feature extraction in
conjunction with similarity metrics to find similar texts. This has broad applications and is very useful in a range of applications.

If you need any help with anything, don't hesitate to contact me! :)
